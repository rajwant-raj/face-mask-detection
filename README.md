# 😷 Face Mask Detection using CNN

A Deep Learning project built for a college internship that detects whether a person is **wearing a face mask** or **not** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
The project includes a trained model, Colab training notebook, and a Streamlit-based web app interface.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The CNN model is trained on the **Face Mask Dataset** containing two classes: `with_mask` and `without_mask`.
2. Images are resized and normalized before being passed to the network.
3. The model predicts the label and confidence based on the input image.
4. A Streamlit interface allows interactive image uploads and visual results.

## ▶️ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone this repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajwant-raj/face-mask-detection.git
   cd face-mask-detection
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

3. Install dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app

`bash
streamlit run app.py
